# # This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# # The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# # Examples:

# #   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
# #   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
